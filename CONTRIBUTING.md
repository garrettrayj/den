# Contributing Guide

## Ways to Contribute

### Issues

Bug reports and requests for enhancements are always welcome and a great way to help the project.

### Code

Nothing speaks quite like code. Checkout the open issues on GitHub for ideas.

### Design

Being primarily developed by a coder, the aesthetics and usability side of the app is always in need of review. The project uses [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com) for graphic design. Assets for inclusion in the app should be Sketch or SVG format vectors. Final assets will be generated before release.

### Translation

While not currently internationalized, efforts are being planned. Get in touch if you'd like to help translate the UI.

## Pull Requests

No strict requirements. Just write a good description.

## General Guidance

The project uses a cutting edge, native, Apple development stack including Swift 5, SwiftUI, MacCatalyst, CoreData, WebKit, and Natural Language. Rock-solid open source libraries, FeedKit, SDWebImage, SwiftSoup, and AEXML round out the dependencies.

A common hurdle that comes up is features that may be easy in plain UIKit, AppKit on Mac, or with higher level libraries may be impossible or so complex it's not worth it.

 Often it's just a matter of waiting for an official solution to make it into SwiftUI. So to summarize, keep it simple and don't spin out on features that "should" be easy but aren't addressed by the core framework yet. There will be ongoing integration of improvements as the stack matures.

## Credits

Significant contributors may be given the option to have a credit line added to a list in the app.

## Administration

Have an idea for a channel on the Discord server? Want a change to the pull request template? Is there a GitHub feature that should be enabled? Setting changed? Make it known by creating an issue or discussion.
