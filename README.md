## Installation

Purchase [Den on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/den-for-rss/id1528917651) to get both iOS and Mac versions with automatic updates.
This project does not currently offer a free binary download.
Of course, it's possible to compile and install with Xcode for free if one is so inclined.

## Mission

Den aims to be a news app so sharp it cuts through misinformation like a white-hot knife through butter.
Old and new tech is blended to create a unique content-focused browsing experience.
Old in the sense that RSS has been around since 1999. 
Decentralized and based on reliable foundations (HTTP, XML, etc.); 
Syndication feeds are still the best way to publish and consume news.
New in the sense that modern devices and networks mean individuals often carry around 
what might as well be a public intelligence workstation in their pocket.
There's no reason to compromise on privacy or control.
Anyone can follow hundreds of publishers with all the conveniences provided by 
cloud storage, machine learning, natural language processing, artificial intelligence, etc.
It's about custom views and automated analysis useful for keeping up with current events.
Without added layers of curation, censorship or monetization.

## Design Philosophy

The icon is a chair because it symbolizes how simple and utilitarian the app aspires to be.
A streamlined basic comfort with reliable mechanisms.
The idea is reflected throughout, from the clean stock interface to the tone of language in messages.
It is just a seat; A place to relax and enjoy looking around at stuff.
Or in other words, it is boring on purpose.

## Publishers

Fairness to publishers is a core part of Den.
No one is favored over another except by way of the user preference.
The app doesn't supplement feed content by reading webpages or fetching data from other sources.
What is in a feed is what is available to the user.
It sanitizes HTML for security and compatibility.
But in general, the sky is the limit.
Information rich feeds gather happy followers.
Happy followers are more likely to convert on goals.
The app does its best to let good content speak for itself.

## Open Source

News apps are the platforms world views are built on. 
Folks should be able to trust their choice without hesitation.
They should also have the freedom to make it better without asking for permission.
Furthermore, they should have a voice in the development of software they may come to depend on.
Thus, Den is open source software for trust, transparency, and community.
