# Den for RSS

## Comfy Feed Browsing

Follow the sources you want with fewer distractions and no funny business.

Den is for creating landscape views of what's happening. Keep up with any topic using dashboards powered by syndication feeds. It's made for folks who want to be informed, but prefer to not be targeted, analyzed, abducted, or probed.

If you're nostalgic for simple blocks of headlines that you can organize yourself, then this is the app for you. Den draws inspiration from internet start pages past, but modernizes the concepts using the latest tech. Flexible, multi-column layouts make it ideal for quickly scanning articles. Native app features and performance deliver a crisp wire surfing experience.
