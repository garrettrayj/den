Den is made for folks who want a less-is-more browsing experience. What sets it apart from other RSS apps is broadsheet layouts that show more content at once, especially on larger screens. Having everything plainly laid out makes finding interesting articles, comparing sources, and noticing trends refreshingly simple.
