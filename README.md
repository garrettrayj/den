Create custom landscape views of what's happening with a modern dashboard-style news aggregator.

The key idea behind Den is that folks are empowered to be more informed and less distracted by clean design, privacy, and complete control over what they follow. It’s made especially for the information manatees; for those who enjoy doing their own thing and don’t always swim with the school fishes.

What sets it apart from other syndication apps is a focus on showing more items upfront. Using it is less like reading email and more like perusing a buffet of headlines. The design lends itself to comparing sources and revealing overarching narratives.
