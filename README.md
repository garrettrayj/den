#  Den

Den is a simple app for watching news feeds. It fetches headlines from syndication sources and shows the links in organizable gadgets. Its purpose is to be a launchpad for buffet-style web browsing. Clean, unobtrusive, and private, it is designed to be a relaxing place to catch up on the news where you are in charge.

The main attraction is the gadget style layout for feeds. From the smallest iPhone to the largest Mac, it adapts to make the most of available screen space. The layout is also ideal for creating highly skimmable dashboards to keep up with any topic. If you like to compare sources, are choosy about what you read, or enjoy tailoring your own big picture, then it is fair to say that Den was made with you in mind.
