# Den for RSS

## Comfy Feed Browsing

Den is a modern news app for iOS and Mac made for creating custom landscape views of what's happening. 

Broadsheet layout options set it apart from others. If you want to see the latest put up on a wall for easy scanning, then this is the app for you. Den shows more content at once with multiple columns on larger screens, and changes to a single column when space is tight.
