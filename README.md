#  Den

Den is a simple app for following syndication feeds. It fetches headlines from RSS or Atom sources and shows the links in organizable gadgets. Inspired by start-page services past such as iGoogle, MyYahoo, and MyMSN; the purpose is to be a private launchpad for buffet style web browsing. Unobtrusive, minimalistic, objective and private, it is designed to be a relaxing place to catch up on the news where you are in charge of what you follow and read.

There are a couple reasons why one might try Den. It is especially good at revealing the big picture. Whether it’s world news, financial markets, or technology; seeing unblended headlines grouped by publisher is uniquely suited to picking out trends and comparing sources. Second, if you’re both overwhelmed and underwhelmed at the same time by aggregator and social media websites, then a starting point with fewer distractions like Den could be the remedy.
