#  Den

Den is a simple app for watching syndication feeds. It fetches headlines from RSS or Atom sources and shows the links in organizable gadgets. Inspired by start-page services past such as iGoogle, MyYahoo, and MyMSN; its purpose is to be a launchpad for buffet style web browsing. Unobtrusive, minimalistic, and private, it is designed to be a relaxing place to catch up on the news where you are in charge.

The main attraction is the scalable grid layout for feeds. From the smallest iPhone to the largest Mac, the interface adapts to make the most of available screen space. Headlines grouped by source is also an ideal foundation for building dashboards to cover virtually any topic. If your like to compare sources and see the big picture then Den is a great way to stay up-to-date with the latest happenings.
