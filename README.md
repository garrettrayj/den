High level views that let you see the big picture is what sets Den apart from other apps. It's not a feed reader per se, but a feed buffet. Skimmable grids make trends aparent and comparing sources natural. A selection of layouts and customizable settings to let you tailor things to see a much or as little as you like. Weather reports, stock alerts, sports scores, and more can all have a place. Reading is powered by Safari or your default browser depending on device.
